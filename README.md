# Exif-data-stripper
I need a image manipulation app that cleans exif data from images so orientation/rotation can be corrected.

It would take all images in a directory, process exif data, facilitate rotation of actual image if needed, remove all exif data, then save image.

This program deletes all EXIF data from selected jpg files.

It is written in Java and executable in Windows, Mac OS, Linux , ...
